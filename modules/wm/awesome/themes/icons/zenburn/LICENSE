The widget icons with the exception of: 'chat', 'crypt', 'power' and
'rss' icons (which were made by me) were originally made by 'sm4tik'
for purposes of 'dzen', I could not find any licensing information
attached to those original bitmaps. Assuming they are in the public
domain I am licensing the widget icons under the terms of the
