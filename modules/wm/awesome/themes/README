This is a collection of themes for Awesome WM (v3.5) I found all over the net. I've cleaned up and improved the themes a little by removing absolute paths and adding fallback wallpapers.

If you're the author of one of these themes and my uploading it here offends you, please drop me a line and I'll take it down.

Installation:
Please note that this is for the current version of Awesome. If you want themes for 3.4 and older, refer to my github repository awesome34-themes (also on AUR).
If you're using ArchLinux, you can install this theme-package from the AUR. 
Otherwise, clone this repository and put the contents into your $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/awesome/themes so that the directory structure looks like this:

├── awesome (e.g. /home/user/.config/awesome)
│   ├── rc.lua
│   ├── themes
│   │   ├── arch
│   │   ├── bamboo
│   │   ├── bio
│   │   ├── blue
│   │   ├── blue_black_red
│   │   ├── blue_black_red_2
│   │   ├── brown
...
