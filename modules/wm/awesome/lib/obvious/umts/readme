UMTS (Ericsson F3705) widget

This widget is a very quick&dirty hack to get data from the Ericsson F3707
UMTS card found in a number of ThinkPad and Dell notebooks.  It gets the
operator name and the signal strength.  Possibly, this should be changed to be
a progressbar rather than a textbox, but ... it works for me.
