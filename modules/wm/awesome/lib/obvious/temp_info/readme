Temperature Zone widget

This widget is a temperature monitor. It gets its information from ACPI, to
make it as correct as possible.

Implementation:
---------------
To use it, include it into your rc.lua by inserting this line (near the top
preferably):
    require("obvious.temp_info")

Then add it to your wibox's widgets list:
    obvious.temp_info()
