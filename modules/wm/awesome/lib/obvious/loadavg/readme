Loadavg Widget
==============

This widget provides the loadavg date as a text box.

For details on the numbers, may read: 
http://www.teamquest.com/resources/gunther/display/5/index.htm


Settings Available (with default values):
-----------------------------------------

 - set_shorttimer(5): Sets the update interval of the widget. (Fast than each 5
   seconds may makes no sense since the data itself does not update more
   quickly in /prov/loadavg

 - set_command("xterm -e htop"): Set what command to issue on Button1 press.

 - set_prefix(""): Sets some text before the loadavg info. May use 'Pango Text
   Markup': http://library.gnome.org/devel/pango/stable/PangoMarkupFormat.html

 - set_suffix(""): Sets the text after the loadavg info.



Implementation:
---------------

To use it, include it into your rc.lua by inserting this line:

  require("obvious.loadavg")

Then may configure it like this:

  obvious.loadavg.set_shorttimer(10)
  obvious.loadavg.set_command("urxvt -e htop")
  obvious.loadavg.set_prefix('<span foreground="#cccccc" font_size="x-large">')
  obvious.loadavg.set_suffix("</span>")
