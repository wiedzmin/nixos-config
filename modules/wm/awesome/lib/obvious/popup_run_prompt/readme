Pop-Up Run Prompt
=================

This widget's purpose is to give you a pop-up run prompt. This widget requires
that you bind it. If the bind is pressed, a wibox appears at the bottom of the
current screen with a run prompt. Once you type the command you want or cancel,
the wibox vanishes.

This Obvious feature is inspired by ion3's similar run prompt that some users
like because of the space-saving style it provides.

Settings available:
-------------------
 - set_opacity: 0-1. Set the opacity of the popping up wibox. Use this if you
   have xcompmgr running and want real transparency.
 - set_prompt_string: The string that is used instead of the default "  Run~ "
   for prompting the user to type.
 - set_prompt_font: Sets the font that the user types in. Uses pango markup.
 - set_slide: true/false. False by default. If this setting is on, rather than
   just having the wibox appear and disappear at the bottom of the screen, it
   slides on and off.
 - set_width: 0-1. Percentage width of screen edge.
 - set_height: number. Height of the run prompt, in pixels.
 - set_border_width: number: Width of border in pixels.
 - set_move_speed: number (in seconds): how fast each step of movement happens
   when the wibox is sliding up/down.
 - set_move_amount: number (in pixels): how many pixels the wibox moves per
   step (set by move_speed)
 - run_function: function: this function gets the input data as its argument,
   default is awful.util.spawn
 - completion_function: function: this function is used for completion,
   default is awful.completion.shell

To set one of these settings, simply do something like:
    obvious.popup_run_prompt.set_opacity(0.7)

Implementation:
---------------
To use it, include it into your rc.lua by inserting this line:
    require("obvious.popup_run_prompt")

Then add a bind to pop up the run prompt in your binds. Bind syntax changes,
but it is roughly:
    awful.key({ modkey }, "r", obvious.popup_run_prompt.run_prompt),
