effortless wmii-style dynamic tagging for awesome

Eminent is a small lua library that monkey-patches awful to provide you with effortless and quick wmii-style dynamic tagging. Unlike shifty, eminent does not aim to provide a comprehensive tagging system, but tries to make dynamic tagging as simple as possible. In fact, besides importing the eminent library, you do not have to change your rc.lua at all, eminent does all the work for you. 

This is a folk from [GLucas/eminent](https://github.com/GGLucas/eminent), with improvments to incorperating with awesome 3.5 or later.
